Scale automation

## NoCode

With the help of NOCODE Tools, many manual processes can be automated. Activities such as the transfer of data from e-mails into a CRM system or updating the newsletter subscriptions can run in the background.

## LowCode

Anyone who encounters the boundaries with noCode tools and wants something more flexibility can reach them through the mix of nocode and code. Individual industrial activities are programmed and inserted into a workflow from nocode automation.

## Code

Risks in individual software development often arise through a downstream complexity if the existing system is to be extended or scaled. I recommend using RedwoodJS to have all the advantages of a modern tech stack and resort to a preconfigured framework.
